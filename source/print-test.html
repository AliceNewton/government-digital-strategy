  <h2 class="section-title" id="executive-summary"><span class="title-index">01</span><span class="title-text">Executive summary</span></h2>

  <p>This strategy sets out how the government will become digital by
default. It fulfils the commitment we made in the <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform">Civil Service Reform Plan</a>.</p>

  <p>By digital by default, we mean digital services that are so
straightforward and convenient that all those who can use them will
choose to do so whilst those who can&rsquo;t are not excluded.</p>

  <p>We estimate that moving services from offline to digital channels will
save between &pound;1.7 and &pound;1.8 billion a year.</p>

  <p>Government is improving the way it provides information by moving to a
single website, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>. Transactional services now present the biggest
opportunity to save people time and save the government money.</p>

  <p>People will only choose to use government services digitally if they are
far more straightforward and convenient. The vast majority (82%) of the
UK population is online but most people rarely use online government services.</p>

  <p>The government provides more than 650 transactional services. There is
only a handful of these services where a significant majority of people who could use the
online option do. Many have a digital option, but few people use it.
Half of these don&rsquo;t offer a digital option at all.</p>

  <p>We will:</p>

  <h4 id="improve-departmental-digital-leadership">Improve departmental digital leadership</h4>

  <p>Departmental executive boards will include an active digital leader.
Transactional services handling over 100,000 transactions each year will
be redesigned, operated and improved by a skilled, experienced
and empowered Service Manager.</p>

  <h4 id="develop-digital-capability-throughout-the-civil-service">Develop digital capability throughout the civil service</h4>

  <p>All departments will ensure that they have the right levels of digital
capability in-house, including specialist skills. Cabinet Office will
support improved digital capability across departments.</p>

  <h4 id="redesign-transactional-services-to-meet-a-new-digital-by-default-service-standard">Redesign transactional services to meet a new digital by default service standard</h4>

  <p>All departments will undertake end-to-end service redesign of all
transactional services with over 100,000 transactions each year. All new
or redesigned transactional services going live after April 2014 will
meet a new digital by default service standard.</p>

  <p>There are 7 departments which between them handle the majority of central government transactions. These are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC)</li>
    <li>Department for Transport (DfT)</li>
    <li>Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</li>
    <li>Ministry of Justice (MoJ)</li>
    <li>Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)</li>
    <li>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</li>
    <li>Home Office</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these departments will agree 3 significant exemplar service transformations with Cabinet Office. These
will be identified and published in departmental digital strategies in December 2012, alongside delivery plans.
Departments will start to redesign these exemplar services by April 2013
and implement them by March 2015.</p>

  <h4 id="complete-the-transition-to-govuk">Complete the transition to GOV.UK</h4>

  <p>Corporate publishing activities of all 24 central government departments
will move onto GOV.UK by March 2013, with agency and arm&rsquo;s length bodies&rsquo;
online publishing to follow by March 2014.</p>

  <h4 id="increase-the-number-of-people-who-use-digital-services">Increase the number of people who use digital services</h4>

  <p>Departments will raise awareness of their digital services so more
people know about and use them, and look at ways to use incentives to encourage digital
adoption.</p>

  <h4 id="provide-consistent-services-for-people-who-have-rarely-or-never-been-online">Provide consistent services for people who have rarely or never been online</h4>

  <p>It is important we do not leave anyone behind in this move to a digital
by default approach. Departments will recognise and understand the needs
of people who can&rsquo;t use digital services. We
will provide appropriate support for these people to use digital
services and other ways to access services for people who need them.</p>

  <h4 id="broaden-the-range-of-those-tendering-to-supply-digital-services-including-more-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises">Broaden the range of those tendering to supply digital services including more small and medium sized enterprises</h4>

  <p>Cabinet Office will offer leaner and more lightweight tendering
processes, as close to the best practice in industry as our regulatory
requirements allow.</p>

  <h4 id="build-common-technology-platforms-for-digital-by-default-services">Build common technology platforms for digital by default services</h4>

  <p>Cabinet Office will lead in the definition and delivery of a new suite
of common technology platforms, to underpin the new generation of
digital by default services.</p>

  <h4 id="remove-unnecessary-legislative-barriers">Remove unnecessary legislative barriers</h4>

  <p>Cabinet Office will work with departments to amend legislation that
unnecessarily prevents us from developing straightforward, convenient
digital services.</p>

  <h4 id="base-service-decisions-on-accurate-and-timely-management-information">Base service decisions on accurate and timely management information</h4>

  <p>Departments will supply a consistent set of management information, as
defined by Cabinet Office, for their transactional services.</p>

  <h4 id="improve-the-way-that-the-government-makes-policy-and-communicates-with-people">Improve the way that the government makes policy and communicates with people</h4>

  <p>Departments will encourage policy teams to use a wider range of digital
tools to communicate with and consult people, both within the UK and
overseas.</p>

  <p>This strategy is just the beginning. We recognise
that the changes required will be far from easy. Our existing processes
and ways of working can get in the way, and many will need to change.</p>

  <p>By December 2012, each department will publish their own departmental
digital strategy explaining what actions they will take to contribute to
this strategy. These actions will provide a framework for continuing
improvements in their services.</p>

  <p>Cabinet Office will operate an annual review process to track
departments&rsquo; progress against the actions in this strategy.</p>

  <p>The strategy does not cover local government services, the NHS, or ways to increase the digital capability of
UK citizens. It also does not deal with the expansion of the broadband network which is being led by Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

  <h2 class="section-title" id="introduction"><span class="title-index">02</span><span class="title-text">Introduction</span></h2>

  <p>This strategy contains 14 actions the government will take to
become digital by default. Digital by default means digital services
which are so straightforward and convenient that all those who can use
digital services will choose to do so, while those who can&rsquo;t are not
excluded.</p>

  <p>This follows the <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform">Civil Service Reform Plan</a> by developing services
that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>allow straightforward access to information and services in times
and in ways that are convenient to the users rather than the
providers</li>
    <li>are more efficient and cost-effective to develop and run</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If we successfully transform our services so they are digital by
default, we can earn a reputation for offering high-quality, responsive, convenient and
up-to-date services.</p>

  <p class="pull">If we successfully transform our services so they are digital by
default, we can earn a reputation for offering high-quality, responsive, convenient and
up-to-date services.</p>

  <p>We made this commitment in response to the review
of Government Online <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution">&lsquo;Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution not Evolution&rsquo;</a> carried out by Martha Lane Fox as UK
Digital Champion in 2010.</p>

  <p>In his foreword to the <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform">Civil Service Reform Plan</a>, Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;Central Government where possible must become a digital organisation.
These days the best service organisations deliver online everything that can be
delivered online.
This cuts their costs dramatically and allows access to information and
services at times and in ways convenient to the users rather than the
providers&rdquo;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> will implement this strategy, supported
by the Digital Leaders&rsquo; network of senior civil servants, the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/04/25/introducing-the-digital-advisory-board/">Digital
Advisory Board</a> and the <a href="https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/">Government Communication Network</a>.</p>

  <p>Each government department will prepare and publish its own departmental
digital strategy. These documents will explain how departments will make
their services digital by default in ways that work for their users.
These strategies will be published by the end of 2012, in time to
influence departments&rsquo; 2013/14 planning process. They will set the
framework for service transformation over the lifetime of the next
spending review.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

  <h2 class="section-title" id="what-the-strategy-is-about"><span class="title-index">03</span><span class="title-text">What the strategy is about</span></h2>

  <p>This strategy is mainly about the services provided by central
government departments and associated agencies and arm&rsquo;s length bodies.
Some matters covered by the strategy are devolved and reference should
be made to the Devolved Administrations for more details as to how this
strategy affect their areas.</p>

  <p>However, in order to provide public services digitally by default, all
public bodies will need to work together. Most public services are
provided by local organisations such as local councils and the NHS.
People often use a range of services, not just one at a time. Most
people and businesses don&rsquo;t differentiate between different levels and
types of public services; they just want a good service.</p>

  <p>To help other organisations improve their digital services, we will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>make the digital assets (standards, designs and code) generated as
a result of this strategy widely available</li>
    <li>share central government plans with local authorities and other
public bodies</li>
    <li>work with local councils and their representative and
professional bodies to help them to make improvements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The actions in this strategy are mainly about transactional services
such as applications, tax, licensing and payments. The strategy explains
how the civil service will develop new skills and approaches to
complement its existing expertise. It also includes actions to improve
the way the government makes policy and communicates with people.</p>

  <p>This strategy is about users of services within the UK. Users overseas
will be covered in appropriate departmental strategies.</p>

  <p>DCMS is already leading on providing <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/telecommunications_and_online/7763.aspx">superfast broadband</a> to at least 90% of premises in the UK and providing universal
access to standard broadband with a speed of at least 2Mbps.</p>

  <h3 id="the-benefits-of-digital-by-default">The benefits of digital by default</h3>

  <p>Digital by default services are more efficient and more convenient for
users. <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/13/quantitative-testing-betagov/">Our initial testing</a> comparing GOV.UK to the previous Directgov
and Businesslink.gov.uk sites shows a more positive rating on both ease of use
(93% compared with 75% before) and speed (80 seconds as opposed to 120
seconds to undertake comparable transactions).</p>

  <p>Government will save money if demand for higher cost channels decreases.
A <a href="http://www.socitm.net/press/article/213/two_thirds_of_customer_contacts_with_local_authorities_are_now_online_says_new_research_from_socitm">2012 SOCITM study</a> across 120 local councils estimated that the cost
of contact for face to face transactions averages &pound;8.62, for phone &pound;2.83, but for web
only 15 pence. The <a href="/digital/efficiency/">Digital Efficiency Report</a> found that the average cost
of a central government digital transaction can be <a href="/digital/efficiency/#fnref:1">almost 20 times
lower than the cost of telephone and 50 times lower than face to face</a>.</p>

  <p>In 2010 <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0910/handling_telephone_enquiries.aspx">HMRC estimated</a> that around 35% of calls to its contact centres
were avoidable at an National Audit Office estimated cost of &pound;75 million a
year. Changes have since been made to processes, letters and forms that
have reduced the total number of calls and the proportion of avoidable
calls to around 26% of the total.</p>

  <p>On the basis of historical savings achieved by existing digital services
we estimate that &pound;1.7 to &pound;1.8 billion of total annual savings could be made by shifting
the transactional services offered by central government departments from offline to
digital channels. Of this, &pound;1.1 to &pound;1.3 billion will be saved directly by the government,
with the rest passed on to service users through lower prices. These figures do not include
the potential costs of a transition to digital, but also do not include the additional
savings that could be gained from fundamental service redesign or back-end technology
changes.</p>

  <p class="fig" id="fig-1"><a href="#fig-1" class="figure-permalink" title="Right click to copy a link to this figure">Link to this</a> 
 Figure 1: Digital take up curve, averaged across case study data</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/strategy/fig1.png" alt="Speed of take-up" /></p>

  <p>Evidence from <a href="/digital/efficiency/#list-of-case-studies">the Digital Efficiency Report case studies</a> demonstrates
public services exhibiting a typical technology adoption S-curve. For
services at around 20% digital take-up, there is the opportunity to
rapidly increase adoption to 80% within 3 to 5 years. This will be further
increased where digitisation is accelerated by a process of fundamental
service redesign based on user needs.</p>

  <p>Digitising transactional services will save people and businesses time
and money; by making transactions faster, reducing the number of failed
transactions and simplifying the end-to-end process. Our estimates
suggest that an hour spent interacting with government <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/cost-of-time.pdf">costs the average
citizen &pound;14.70</a>. If just half an hour were saved by digitising every transaction currently completed offline, the total savings to the
economy <a href="/digital/efficiency/#estimates-of-total-annual-savings">could therefore be around &pound;1.8 billion</a>. 
Furthermore, many public services are run by agencies that recover their 
costs directly through user charges, so reducing costs provides the potential 
for savings to be passed on to users.</p>

  <p>82% of the UK population are currently online and there is a clear opportunity for government to deliver services
digitally to them. Although 77% of adults in the UK use 
the internet daily, <a href="/digital/research/#fig-2">many of them have never had any online interaction 
with government</a>.</p>

  <p>A growing proportion of people are <a href="/digital/research/#fig-3">willing and able to use more complex
digital services</a> that involve a high level of trust such as shopping and
online banking. An <a href="http://microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/oxis/">Oxford Internet Institute survey (OxIS)</a> from 2011 shows that the proportion of internet users who shop online grew from 74% in 2005 to 86% in 2011;
online banking usage grew from 45% in 2005 to 60% in 2011; and internet
users who pay bills online grew from 39% in 2005 to 57% in 2011.</p>

  <p>The popularity of online channels is recognised across the private
sector, demonstrated by the fact that <a href="http://www.zenithoptimedia.com/zenith/zenithoptimedia-releases-new-ad-forecasts-global-advertising-continues-to-grow-despite-eurozone-fears/">internet advertising&rsquo;s share of
total UK advertising spend has risen to 33%</a>, well ahead of any other country, as
UK advertisers respond to their customers&rsquo; attention shifting online.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, digital services are rapidly gaining strong reputations and
loyalty from users. A <a href="http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/07/11/best-amazon-google-bbc-iplayer/">recent YouGov poll</a> saw Amazon, Google and iPlayer
become the highest-rated brands in the UK, overtaking more traditional
companies such as John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer.</p>

  <p>The people who use digital services do so for <a href="/digital/research/#fig-4">reasons of speed and
convenience</a>. 
The most frequent reasons people gave for choosing to use digital transactions were: it saved me a lot of time (85%), the site was clear and easy to use (62%), and I could do it outside office hours (61%).</p>

  <p>54% of UK adults have used a government service/information online,
but most of those have used only a small number of services, and many
have just used one. Moreover, according to 2011 <a href="http://microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/oxis/">OxIS research</a>, 
the number of people using online government services has steadily increased from 39% in 2005 to 57% in 2011, but since 2007
this reach has plateaued.</p>

  <h3 id="helping-more-people-to-use-online-services">Helping more people to use online services</h3>

  <p>Not everyone is online. Through our assisted digital programme, we will
help more people to use online services.</p>

  <p>Those in higher socio-economic groups (ABCs) are <a href="/digital/research/#fig-5">more likely to be online</a>, 
with 92% regularly or occasionally accessing the internet. 28%
of disabled people are not online (rarely access/have never used the
internet), and older people are more likely to be offline than other age
groups (however 59% of people aged over 65 are online). Geography
doesn&rsquo;t appear to have too great an influence on whether people access
the internet or not, as people are offline in urban, suburban and rural
areas.</p>

  <p>A third of the people who are offline (ie 6% of the UK population) said they are interested in using
the internet, suggesting that the number of people who are online
may increase over time.</p>

  <h3 id="people-who-use-mobile-devices-to-get-online">People who use mobile devices to get online</h3>

  <p>Digital services must adapt seamlessly to meet the needs of mobile
internet users. The new digital service standard will include a
requirement to design digital services that are usable on mobile devices
as well as desktop and laptop computers.</p>

  <p>In recent years there have been large advances in the portability and
range of internet enabled devices. This has <a href="/digital/research/#fig-6">changed the way users access
the internet</a>. The most popular devices used to access the internet are
laptops and desktops (73% and 59% respectively), but mobile phone
ownership is now widespread (86% of UK adults have a mobile phone). 56%
of UK adults own a mobile that is internet-enabled, and their use to
access the internet is growing.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/balf/london-2012com-olympic-games-digital-round-up-13-august-2012">London 2012 Olympic Games provides a recent example of this trend
towards mobile use</a>, with over 60% of all visitors to the Games&rsquo; website
coming from mobile phones.</p>

  <p><a href="http://microsites.oii.ox.ac.uk/oxis/">OxIS research</a> shows that ownership of internet-enabled phones continues to grow among all income
groups. This will increase the number of people who can access the
internet. There is little correlation between the use of mobiles for the
internet and annual income, with 35% of mobile internet users earning
above &pound;30,000 and 39% earning below &pound;12,500. With 69% of current
non-internet users owning a mobile, there is scope to increase access to
internet-based information and services through this route.</p>

  <p>Based on banking industry experience, this mobile web usage tends to be
focused on simple straightforward transactions, notably progress
tracking. This offers the potential to shift a high volume of this type of transaction across to digital
self-service, resulting in savings from reduced use of more expensive telephony channels.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title" id="what-we-have-already-done"><span class="title-index">05</span><span class="title-text">What we have already done</span></h2>

  <p>Government&rsquo;s online information services are closer to becoming users&rsquo;
preferred (default) option than its transactional services.</p>

  <p>Government online publishing is in the process of being transformed by
the GOV.UK programme, a radical simplification of government web
publishing started in 2011 in response to <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution">Martha Lane Fox&rsquo;s review</a>. The
GOV.UK website (which replaced the previous Directgov and Businesslink.gov.uk
sites in October 2012 in providing government information for citizens
and businesses) has already demonstrated that it is simpler, clearer and
faster for users.</p>

  <p>Government already uses digital channels for most of its communications,
marketing and engagement. Most departments and many agencies have
developed expertise in using social media and other third-party digital
properties such as YouTube to communicate with people and businesses,
rather than paying for other channels. <a href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/">The Red Tape
Challenge</a>
and <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/">e-petitions</a> are 2 examples of
this approach.</p>

  <p>Government has also made some progress in providing convenient,
well-used and well regarded transactional digital services. For example,
digital is the preferred channel for most users of Companies House, with
an <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/261356/channel_strategy_cases.pdf">89% online take-up of annual returns search and filing</a> achieved in
just 5 years, and for HMRC&rsquo;s Self Assessment tax service where a
record <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/business-plan-2012.pdf">80% of returns were filed online in 2011/12</a>.</p>

  <p>Progress is also being made in making government information and
transactions more widely and conveniently available through third
parties. <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/business-plan-2012.pdf">Over two thirds of the 7.65 million Self Assessment
transactions received online by HMRC are submitted via third-party
software and service providers</a>. Over 1,500 such third-party commercial providers are accredited to use HMRC&rsquo;s third party integration suite (APIs).</p>

  <p>Around 30% of digital filings to Companies House are made via its
software filing service which offers an API for the transmission of data
from commercial software packages. The clients of over 80 software
providers use this service.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

  <h2 class="section-title" id="developing-digital-transactions"><span class="title-index">06</span><span class="title-text">Developing digital transactions</span></h2>

  <p>Transactional services are the primary focus of this strategy. This is
because developing transactional services offers the greatest scope to
improve efficiency and the customer experience. A focus on developing these makes an important contribution to the government&rsquo;s <a href="http://files.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/HMG_OpenPublicServices_web.pdf">Open Public Services agenda</a>, supporting increased personalisation and choice within public services. And despite the progress
outlined above, they are also the area where there is the most work to
be done to improve the digital offer and increase user take-up.</p>

  <p>There is <a href="http://transactionalservices.alphagov.co.uk/">a huge volume of transactions with government</a>. 
There were around 1 billion individual transactions a year with central government
departments in 2011/12. This number rises to nearer 1.5 billion when
other governmental organisations such as local government are taken into
account.</p>

  <p>These transactions are not evenly spread across departments, with just
7 responsible for around 90% of the central government transactions.
These are HMRC, DfT, DWP, BIS, DEFRA, MoJ, and the Home Office.</p>

  <p>Whilst the majority of transactions are between government and
individuals, there are also a significant number of transactions between
government and business. This includes some which are very complex and
high value (for example farming payments). In these cases, the use of
specialist third-party intermediary organisations is common. The process
improvements recommended in this strategy will support these
arrangements.</p>

  <h3 id="what-is-preventing-people-from-using-digital-transactions">What is preventing people from using digital transactions?</h3>

  <p>Most government transactions fall far short of the standard of the best.
Unlike successful digital services in the private sector, government&rsquo;s
online services are not necessarily better or more convenient than other
channels, meaning they will not be users&rsquo; first choice to transact with
us.</p>

  <p>For example, in some circumstances it is quicker to apply for some
services by phone than by using the existing online service. In 2011,
around 150 million calls a year coming into government <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/freedom-information-contact-centre-benchmarking-data">were
self-reported as avoidable</a>. Such failure is frustrating and
time-consuming for users but it is also costly for government. If users
have to revert back to other channels, then meeting this additional &lsquo;failure demand&rsquo;
is an unnecessary additional cost.</p>

  <p>There are several causes of these failures. Many government services
rely on digitised versions of pre-digital business processes, layered on
top of legacy IT systems, some of which are over 30 years old. They were not
designed with a digital service in mind, being built to replicate paper
forms and processes rather than taking advantage of opportunities to
pre-populate or respond to user&rsquo;s selections. They have outdated back-end systems which prevent effective data sharing, and/or they have
long-term contracts locked into expensive vendors making changes to
services costly and slow.</p>

  <p>Each service has often been designed individually, rather than
developing a consistent approach to user experience across the
government digital estate. Hence the user experience of government
transactions is inconsistent and unnecessarily confusing, particularly
to less confident users.</p>

  <p>Leading private sector digital businesses have learned that familiarity
drives usage, and usage drives familiarity. This lack of a consistent,
high-quality user experience is a critical issue holding back
performance and adoption of our digital services.</p>

  <p>Despite evidence of growing use of mobile devices as the route into
digital channels, only a handful of government digital services cater
fully for the needs of mobile internet users. Very few government
digital services are flexible or agile enough to keep up with the rapid
changes in user behaviour typified by the growth of the mobile sector.
If existing lengthy procurement processes and inflexible development
models continue, they will be similarly poorly placed to adapt at any
pace to future changes in how people prefer to use the internet.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform">Civil Service Reform Plan</a> acknowledges that we need to develop the
right capability and skills to design, communicate and deliver the
high-quality digital services we require. This digital strategy aligns
with the Civil Service Capabilities Plan; both will be woven into
departments&rsquo; own strategic planning, including their new Improvement
Plans.</p>

  <p>There has been an over-reliance on a handful of large systems
integrators, <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/report-on-Government-it-published/">referred to by the Public Administration Select Committee
(PASC) as an &lsquo;oligopoly&rsquo;</a>. As a result, the civil service does not have
the necessary depth of understanding and ownership of our digital
channels to act as an &ldquo;intelligent client&rdquo;. This makes services less
efficient and less effective for users.</p>

  <p>There are also weaknesses in the consistency, timeliness, accuracy and
scope of management information to measure performance and costs between
different services and channels. This means we may miss opportunities to
target areas of waste, identify improvement opportunities or measure the
benefits of change.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

  <h2 class="section-title" id="assisted-digital"><span class="title-index">07</span><span class="title-text">Assisted digital</span></h2>

  <p>We recognise that not everyone who uses government services is online, and that not everyone will be able to use digital services independently.
The government has to ensure fair access to services for those who are entitled to them. 
To design services that work for users, we need to understand who can use digital services, who can&rsquo;t, and what else we need to provide for people who aren&rsquo;t online.</p>

  <p>What we provide for people who aren&rsquo;t online will depend on the service
and the needs of the user. Many people who are offline will keep using
the services in non-digital ways, such as face to face, by phone and
through intermediaries. In some cases, people may be offered help to use
the digital channel.</p>

  <p>We call this &lsquo;assisted digital&rsquo;. This is an integral part of providing
digital by default services. Departments will consider how they will
provide this assistance at the same time as they are digitally
transforming their services. Government Digital Service will work with
departments to develop a cross-government approach to this issue. This
is to ensure those users who need this help receive a consistent service
across the multiple services they use.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">

  <h2 class="section-title" id="persuading-those-who-are-online-to-use-government-digital-services"><span class="title-index">08</span><span class="title-text">Persuading those who are online to use government digital services</span></h2>

  <p>We want those who are able to use our digital services to do so. For
those who can and do use digital services already, the actions outlined
in this strategy will result in a better user experience and a wider
range of high quality digital services.</p>

  <p>To persuade people to use government digital services, we need to
improve the quality of the services to make them clearly preferable to
the alternatives.</p>

  <p>We also need to make people aware of the services that are available. A
number of techniques can be used to raise awareness and encourage people
to use digital channels. Departments will consider which methods are
most appropriate to the context of their service, and the needs of their
service users.</p>

  <p>Departments will learn from the expertise of organisations who have
successfully undertaken &lsquo;channel shift&rsquo; to digital services.</p>

  <h3 id="what-about-things-that-cant-be-done-online">What about things that can&rsquo;t be done online?</h3>

  <p>Not every step of every interaction with government can, or should, be
entirely digitised &ndash; a practical driving test can&rsquo;t be taken online.
But even services that inherently involve face to face contact can be
redesigned - digitally - around the needs of users.</p>

  <p>For example, while over 90% of practical driving tests are booked
online, driving examiners still fill in and file paper forms to confirm
who has passed their test, adding cost and delay for users that a truly
end-to-end digital service could remove. Driving Standards Agency is
aiming to trial the introduction of mobile devices so that examiners don&rsquo;t have to
fill in paper forms. They will be able to pass on test information to
the next stages of the process more swiftly and efficiently.</p>

  <p>Over time, the success of better designed digital services will allow
government to reduce the scale and profile of less convenient, less effective
and less cost-efficient contact methods (telephony, face to face, post).</p>

  <h3 id="redesigning-services-around-the-needs-of-users">Redesigning services around the needs of users</h3>

  <p>The most important part of this strategy is the need to redesign
government services to respond to user needs.</p>

  <p>We can learn lessons from other organisations which are succeeding in
digital transformation such as high street banks or the BBC:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>basing service design on user needs is essential to ensure quality
and reduce the cost of failure waste</li>
    <li>modern, flexible, common technology platforms are needed for
frequently iterated, consistent user-focused services</li>
    <li>policy and delivery are best tightly integrated into one
co-located team during any redesign of a digital service</li>
    <li>specialist technical architecture, development, design and
analytics skills are essential, alongside new senior leadership
roles, including that of a fully accountable and empowered service
manager</li>
    <li>once services are redesigned to meet user needs, they need to be
communicated and marketed effectively, by targeting appropriate
messages to identified user groups through a range of trusted
channels and intermediaries</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>offer extensive training and support to help new Service Managers</li>
    <li>help departments to recruit Service Managers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Private sector organisations that have been at the forefront of
delivering digital transformation have repeatedly indicated the
importance of leadership at all levels to their success. It is therefore
important that we ensure that suitably skilled and empowered leadership
is in place within departments and agencies to lead service
transformation.</p>

  <p>Digital Leaders will provide active senior leadership for departmental
digital strategies and activities and provide expertise and challenge to
their boards. Cabinet Office will help boards to identify Digital
Leaders with suitable experience and skills (role specification in Annex
5). These will usually be members of the departmental executive (or
management) board. In a number of departments, these are already in
place.</p>

  <p>In agencies and arm&rsquo;s length bodies that deliver significant
transactional services, similar active board-level leadership is
critical to achieving successful service transformation.</p>

  <p>Outside government, organisations in the public and private sector are
learning that empowered, experienced and highly skilled managers (often
called &lsquo;product managers&rsquo; in the commercial world) are necessary to
deliver high-quality digital services.</p>

  <p>Government will adopt the same model, and ensure each of its
transactional digital services handling over 100,000 transactions each year is
developed, operated and continually improved by an experienced,
skilled and empowered Service Manager. 
These are not technical IT posts, nor are they confined to running a
website. Instead, they are individuals who work full-time to develop and deliver
all the changes necessary to provide effective digital services. With a
handful of exceptions, this is a new role within government. These
Service Managers will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>be experienced leaders, with an in-depth understanding of their
service (built on continuity of involvement over a period of years)
and equipped to represent their service and its users&rsquo; needs at all
levels within the organisation. For high-profile services these will
be at Senior Civil Servant level</li>
    <li>be accountable for the quality and usage of their service, and
able to iterate the service based on user feedback at least every
month</li>
    <li>be able to lead effectively on the change management and process
re-engineering required to implement successful services</li>
    <li>have the digital literacy to engage with technical staff and
suppliers to define the best system and platform configurations to
achieve business/user objectives</li>
    <li>encourage the maximum possible take-up of their digital service by
effective marketing, and specify/manage the requirements for
assisted digital activity to supplement this</li>
    <li>oversee service redesign and subsequent operational delivery;
supporting and ensuring the necessary project and approval processes
are followed, monitoring and reporting on progress in line with the
digital by default service standard, identifying and mitigating
risks, and be empowered to deliver on all aspects</li>
    <li>actively participate in networking with other Service Managers
inside and outside government, and share good practice and learning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Cabinet Office will help departments to recruit suitably skilled
individuals. Newly appointed Service Managers will be supported by
Cabinet Office through a specialist training programme run by the
Government Digital Service. This will include the hands-on process of
designing and prototyping a digital service.</p>

skill-sets depending on the balance of information and services the
department is responsible for. It will typically include specialist
digital skills in digital service design, development, analytics,
digital strategy, online publishing and product management. Departments
with lower volumes of transactions could share specialist digital
resources.</p>

  <p>Government Digital Service is already working with departments to
support 7 transformational service redesign projects. This support
will continue, and be extended. Annex 2 describes the support that is
available.</p>

  <p>To complement this internal development, approaches to recruitment will
need to be adapted to attract staff with appropriate skills from outside

  <h4 id="action-05" class="section-title"><span class="title-index"><span>Action </span> 05</span><span class="title-text">All departments will redesign services handling over 100,000 transactions each year</span></h4>

  <p>For the 7 &lsquo;transactional&rsquo; departments (HMRC, DfT, DWP, BIS, DEFRA, MoJ, and the Home Office):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>3 significant &lsquo;exemplar&rsquo; services will be agreed with Cabinet
Office and identified in departmental digital strategies in December 2012, 
alongside delivery plans</li>
    <li>redesign will start by April 2013 and the service must be
implemented by March 2015</li>
    <li>following this and using the learning from the exemplars,
departments will redesign all services handling over 100,000
transactions each year, unless an exemption has been agreed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For the remaining departments:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>departments will redesign all services handling over 100,000
transactions each year, unless an exemption has been agreed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="action-06" class="section-title"><span class="title-index"><span>Action </span> 06</span><span class="title-text">From April 2014, all new or redesigned transactional services will meet the digital by default service standard</span></h4>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>publish the digital by default service standard, which will
describe the performance metrics and capabilities that services must
achieve. An indicative outline is published in Annex 3</li>
    <li>provide a programme of support, guidance and tools that help
service teams meet the standard throughout the development and life
of the service</li>
    <li>agree with departments the deadlines for when digital services are
to be redesigned</li>
    <li>increase the scale of its transformation team to support more
transactional service redesign projects</li>
    <li>help departments to share what they learn from exemplar projects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government digital services are inconsistent and often do not meet the
standards that users expect. To ensure that users receive a consistently
high-quality digital experience from government, Cabinet Office will
develop a service standard for all digital
services. No new or redesigned service will go live unless they meet
this standard.</p>

  <p>The full standard will be published by the Cabinet Office by April 2013.</p>

  <p>In summary, it will require redesigned digital services to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>be developed based on user need using agile, iterative, digital
development methodologies and using open source code by default</li>
    <li>be designed, run and continually improved by a skilled
and empowered Service Manager</li>
    <li>be iterated at least monthly based on qualitative feedback from
users and quantitative measures from analytics</li>
    <li>be designed for inclusion, so all who should use it can use it,
and include appropriate assisted digital support for people who
can&rsquo;t</li>
    <li>offer high-quality APIs, allowing departments to integrate
services, and make these available to third-parties where there is a
demonstrable user benefit</li>
    <li>be designed to work well on a wide range of web-enabled devices,
including mobile phones. Stand-alone mobile apps will only be
considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices,
and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office</li>
    <li>use common technology platforms</li>
    <li>publish as much learning and code with the public as is possible</li>
    <li>be measured against success in meeting user needs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Where services are outsourced on a payment by results basis we will
ensure a consistent and high quality user experience, aligned with the
digital by default service standard.</p>

  <p>An indicative outline of this service standard is
available in Annex 3.</p>

  <p>The majority of the benefits will be achieved by the 7 transactional
departments. Therefore we will focus on redesigning their services as a
first priority, with three &lsquo;exemplar&rsquo; services in each of these
departments receiving end to end redesign by March 2015.</p>

  <p>Service redesign and prototyping work for these exemplar services will
start in April 2013 or earlier. For each service identified for
redevelopment, a proposed delivery plan will be prepared, showing how
the department will resource the project including meeting the
challenges in senior digital leadership, appointing a suitably skilled
Service Manager to lead from the inception of the redesign process, and
undertaking service design and project and product management. Any
funding required will be found by departments from within existing
budgets, re-prioritised where necessary.</p>

  <p>Departments will share the learning from the transformation of these
exemplar services to increase digital capability across the civil
service.</p>

  <p>All departments will redesign all their transactional services that
handle over 100,000 transactions each year for completion by the end of
the next spending review period. In November 2012 there were <a href="http://transactionalservices.alphagov.co.uk/">152 transactions that met this threshold</a>.
In exceptional circumstances departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example where a business case for digital by default service design does not demonstrate good value for money. Any put forward would be agreed at a cross-government level.</p>

  <p>Departments will identify which services they transform first, for
agreement with Cabinet Office. Annex 4 identifies a number of criteria
which departments should consider when selecting which services to
redesign to ensure the greatest benefit to users and savings to
government. We recognise that DWP&rsquo;s introduction of Universal Credit
means that a major and wide-reaching digital transformation programme
affecting all areas of the department is already underway. As such,
Cabinet Office will take a flexible approach as to any further
commitments to redesigning services prior to March 2015.</p>

  <p>Cabinet Office will measure progress annually and publish the
results.</p>

  <p>Departments with direct responsibility for fewer than 1 million
transactions each year will transfer their information on to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>, but
their departmental digital strategies will include clear plans for the
future transformation of their services to digital by default.</p>

  <p>The Government Digital Service is already supporting 7 transactional
transformation projects across central government (see table below). It
will increase the scale of this support.</p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;Simpler, clearer and faster for users&rdquo;</em></p>

  <h4 id="action-07" class="section-title"><span class="title-index"><span>Action </span> 07</span><span class="title-text">Corporate publishing activities of all 24 central government departments will move onto <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> by March 2013, with agency and arm&rsquo;s length bodies&rsquo; online publishing to follow by March 2014</span></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>resources for the transition to GOV.UK will be included in
departmental digital strategies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>help departments to transfer online publishing to GOV.UK</li>
    <li>continue to operate and improve the GOV.UK online publishing
platform at no cost to departments, agencies or arms length bodies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In October 2012, government took the first step towards enabling access
to all departments&rsquo;, agencies&rsquo; and arms length bodies&rsquo; digital
information and transactional services to citizens and businesses using
one web address. GOV.UK has replaced Directgov and Businesslink.gov.uk as a
single domain for government on the web.</p>

  <p>GOV.UK has demonstrated how these methodologies can deliver high quality
digital products that meet user needs, and are more efficient for
government. <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/13/quantitative-testing-betagov/">In large scale user testing</a>, 93% of users rated GOV.UK as
very/quite easy to use versus 75% for Directgov. Similarly, when looking
for information, respondents using GOV.UK took an average of 80 seconds,
as opposed to 120 seconds on Directgov.</p>

  <p>Between November 2012 to March 2013, the corporate publishing activities
of 24 government departments will move onto GOV.UK. By March 2014, the
information publishing aspects of all department, agency and arms length
bodies websites (other than those granted a specific business-based
exemption) will transfer to GOV.UK.</p>

  <h3 id="principle-increase-the-number-of-people-who-use-digital-services">Principle: Increase the number of people who use digital services</h3>

  <p><em>&ldquo;More users, using more services, more often&rdquo;</em></p>

  <h4 id="action-08" class="section-title"><span class="title-index"><span>Action </span> 08</span><span class="title-text">Departments will raise awareness of their digital services so that more people know about them and use them</span></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>departments will set out plans to encourage channel shift in
departmental digital strategies. These will be reviewed annually</li>
    <li>departments will publish plans that clearly identify the
savings they expect to make as a result of increased use of
digital services</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>share examples of success across departments</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In order to maximise the benefits from transformed digital services,
departments must work to accelerate their take-up, shifting users able
to access the internet away from non-digital channels. Departmental
digital strategies will include clear plans for encouraging the move
from offline to digital channels, through awareness raising, involvement
of front-line staff and appropriate use of incentives.</p>

  <p>Departments will re-assess the effectiveness of their promotional
activities to maximise the awareness of new and existing digital
services, and encourage those who could use them to trial them. This
does not have to involve expensive marketing campaigns. It will build on
service experience and expertise in behavioural insight and behaviour
change in the public and private sectors to raise the profile of digital
services, and encourage users to use them.</p>

  <p>A key element of the channel shift approach will involve existing
front-line staff (both face to face and telephony). They should be made
proficient in the use of digital services and encouraged, trained and
equipped to support people in trialling and using the services
themselves (for example by having the same front end access to a service
system as the user, making explanation and support more
straightforward). As digital take-up increases, the role of front-line
staff may evolve, for example becoming the assisted digital channel of
choice for the service.</p>

  <p>As well as ensuring users are aware of digital channels, the transition
to digital as the channel of choice can be facilitated by use of
incentives. A number of techniques have been trialled, such as passing
on lower costs where fees are based on cost recovery, as Companies House
did for company registrations; allowing later deadlines for online
process completion, as used in HMRC&rsquo;s personal tax assessment
transactions; or by entries into prize draws for online users, as
offered by DVLA. Departments will be encouraged to trial a range of
positive incentives to encourage digital adoption.</p>

  <p>The Government Digital Service will work with Service Managers to
collate and share experience and tools developed through initial
transformation projects, as well as drawing in appropriate expertise
from the commercial sector to share experience and techniques for
facilitating channel shift.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This means that people who have rarely or never been online will be
able to access services offline, and we will provide additional ways for
them to use the digital services</p>

  <ul>
    <li>departments will explain in their digital strategies how they will
ensure that digital services include a consistent service for people
who have rarely or never been online</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will continue to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>work with departments to agree a cross-government approach to
assisted digital, to be published by December 2012</li>
    <li>work with organisations representing people who can&rsquo;t use digital
services to develop the cross-government approach</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The government has to provide public services to everyone who is
entitled to them. <a href="/digital/research/#fig-1">18% of adults have rarely or never been online</a>.
Digital by default means that digital self-service is the default option
for people who can use it, not the only option.</p>

  <p>To ensure that people who are offline can access digital by default
services, we will offer them ways to access services offline, and we
will provide additional ways for them to use the digital services. These
services must be designed to meet user needs. We call this &lsquo;assisted
digital&rsquo;.</p>

  <p>We need to make sure that government takes a consistent approach to
providing services for people who have rarely or never been online. This
will be better for users and more efficient for government.</p>

  <p>The approach will include a range of possible ways to provide services
for people who are rarely or never online, depending on what the user
needs are and how complex the service is. For example, for simpler
transactions with a small proportion of users who don&rsquo;t use online
services, departments may use contact centres to provide another way to
access the service. For more complex transactions and a high proportion
of people who are not online, departments may use a mix of face to face,
phone and paper support. Face to face support may involve having people
helping users to do their transaction on terminals, or a user being able
to give their details to a person who will enter it into the digital
service on their behalf.</p>

  <p>Front-line staff have a vital role to play. They will support users who
need help with digital services and continue to provide other ways for
people who are not online to access services. Private or voluntary and
community sector organisations may also be involved.</p>

  <p>The Government Digital Service, departments and stakeholders including Age UK, Post Office, Online Centres Foundation, Citizens Advice, Go ON UK, Society of Chief Librarians, Digital Unite, Communications Consumer Panel, Carers UK, UCanDoIT, Shelter, Shaw Trust, and Lasa are working together on the cross-government approach to assisted digital. 
Within government, we are also working with Arts Council England and BDUK.</p>

  <p>The government will publish plans by December 2012. Departmental digital strategies will also reflect these plans.</p>

  <p>This strategy is not about generally encouraging more people to go
online, or increasing people&rsquo;s skills to use digital services.
Departments with larger proportions of users who are not online may wish
to supplement their assisted digital provision with activity to increase
the digital capability of their users. If so, this would be funded by
existing departmental budgets. As well as developing the approach to
assisted digital, the Government Digital Service is collaborating with
Go ON UK in their work to help make the UK the most digitally capable
nation in the world.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>work with departments as part of its strategic supplier management
function to maintain a forward looking pipeline of digital work,
updated quarterly. This will enable businesses to invest in
capability and resources appropriately</li>
    <li>use the existing spend controls process to encourage better
pre-market engagement, shaping specifications to take advantage
where appropriate of the market&rsquo;s latest offerings and innovations</li>
    <li>encourage suppliers who are new to government to undertake any bidder training needed to lower the effective barrier to entry for new
vendors, as part of the existing commitment to ensure 25% of
departmental external spend is with small and medium sized enterprises</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will continue to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>offer training and awareness-raising to departmental procurement
leads in support of new procurement arrangements </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In 2009, <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/317444/ict_strategy4.pdf">the public sector spent around 1% of GDP on IT</a>. Departments
currently rely on a few, large systems integrators to supply their
digital requirements. They can lack the in-house expertise to act as a
challenging and informed client, and this has resulted in expensive and
inflexible long-term contracts which do not support delivery of services
likely to meet the forthcoming digital service standard.</p>

  <p>However, the UK has a burgeoning digital technology sector with a wide
range of highly skilled and innovative companies, including small and medium sized enterprises who are
often unable to access the government procurement market due to high
barriers to entry and complex, expensive and often frustrating
processes.</p>

  <p>The need to redesign services to be digital by default is an opportunity
to secure greater value for government, by changing how we commission
our services, developing in-house capabilities and reducing our reliance
on a few large systems integrators. Cabinet Office will build on
existing procurement reform to develop new commissioning arrangements
for digital projects, to encourage a wider range of bidders, including
small and medium sized enterprises.</p>

  <p>This will be accompanied by training and awareness raising for
departmental procurement leads on the requirements for the new approach.
To achieve this shift, there will be a recognition that work
will not inevitably go to the cheapest bidder, but that more flexible
contracts with suppliers will be explored and assessed with a view to
what longer-term value they will bring to government by providing agile
and scalable solutions that meet user needs.</p>

  <p>A number of new techniques will be introduced to the commissioning
process to enable departments to gain a deeper understanding of the
capabilities of prospective suppliers. These may include collaborative
procurement techniques where face to face time is maximised with
prospective suppliers and scenarios are used to understand supplier
capabilities and approaches. Another technique may see the use of
prototyping, where &lsquo;model&rsquo; systems will be constructed for prospective
suppliers to prove their integration capabilities and technical prowess
of their staff. Both of these methods will be supported by fair and
objective scoring.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/government-ict-strategy">ICT Strategy</a> stressed the need for government to procure its
technical infrastructure - its servers, internet hosting, etc - as
commodity services. The <a href="http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/">CloudStore</a> framework is an example of this shift,
with over 300 suppliers offering cloud-based solutions on a
pay-as-you-use basis, with a maximum 12 months contract. The learning
from the development of the CloudStore framework will be fed into other
digital procurement and commissioning reform.</p>

further common platform components</li>
    <li>help to define, develop and provide shared technology platforms to

  </ul>

  <p>Cabinet Office will lead in the definition and delivery of a range
of common cross-government technology platforms, in consultation with
departments to ensure they meet business needs. These will underpin the
new generation of digital services. Departments will be
expected to use these for new and redesigned services, unless a specific
case for exemption is agreed.</p>

  <p>We know that our users often find it hard to register for our online
services, so it is vital that we offer a more straightforward, secure
way to allow our users to identify themselves online while preserving
their privacy. The Identity Assurance programme in the Cabinet Office
will continue to develop a framework to enable federated identity
assurance to be adopted across government services in due course. All
our work in this area is guided by the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/04/24/identityand-privacy-principles/">Identity and Privacy Principles</a>
drawn up by our Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group.</p>

  <p>The Government Digital Service is also developing a data insight
platform that will combine a range of data including analytics, web
operations and financial information. Using clear visualisations, it
will provide high level performance reports for leaders and more
detailed data for service managers.</p>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>offer specialist digital expertise to interpret existing legislation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In a few areas, laws made before the digital age can severely constrain
the development of simple, convenient digital services. For
example, HMRC have to provide tax coding notifications on paper rather
than by electronic channels. Cabinet Office will work with
departments to identify these potential barriers and ways to remove
them. This could mean either reviewing current restrictive
interpretations of laws passed before digital methods existed or, in
some cases, by considering whether legislation needs to be changed. The <a href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">Red Tape Challenge</a> is examining some 6,500 substantive
regulations and identifying at least 3,000 to scrap or overhaul. This includes finding ways to reduce burdens for businesses, taxpayers and individuals by moving to digital methods.</p>

  <p>Policy and legal experts will work closely with digital specialists and
those who are responsible for designing services to find a solution to
any problems identified. We will hold these discussions early in each
design process and continue them throughout development (some may also
emerge during implementation and operational stages). We will share the
solutions widely across departments to help with consistency and
smoother joint working.</p>

    <li>digital by default services will include automated collection of
management information</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>share a list of required data sets with departments by December 2012</li>
    <li>help departments to define, collect, store and present performance data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Service Managers and decision-makers need high quality, consistent
management information to make sound decisions and help them monitor and
improve performance. Some services collect and assess detailed
performance data but most digital services still do not have good enough
management information.</p>

  <p>Cabinet Office will establish a consistent set of management
information measures which departments will use, meaning they can
effectively compare performance across time and against similar
services. Collection of this information will be built into every new or
redesigned digital service.</p>

  <p>Reliable management information makes it possible for good performers to be
identified and given recognition. Service performance will not only be
bench-marked against historical performance, but also standards
recognised as best practice.</p>

  <p>Service performance will be measured through a clear and consistent set
of indicators. These will include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>cost per transaction. This measures whether a service is using a
cost-effective set of delivery channels and whether users are
choosing to use more or less expensive channels to complete their
transaction</li>
    <li>user satisfaction. This enables service owners to identify
potential weaknesses in a service and areas to focus improvement
efforts</li>
    <li>transaction completion rates. This may highlight possible process
flaws or ambiguities in the service although abandonment measures
have to be designed and monitored with an understanding of each
transaction stage (for example, identifying where users drop out as
a result of establishing that they are ineligible for a service in
the course of an application)</li>
    <li>take-up levels. This illustrates how rapidly users are adopting
new digital channels and where additional or different marketing may
be useful</li>

  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>departments will incorporate plans in their departmental digital
strategies to listen to and understand conversations in social
media, use the insight gained to inform the policy-making process
and to collaborate more effectively with partners</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Government Digital Service will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>continue to offer support, training and guidance to departments</li>
    <li>release a range of tools on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> platform to enable policy
teams to engage and consult more effectively</li>
    <li>keep the civil service social media guidance up to date</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Transactional services and information are the primary focus of our
digital by default approach, but digital also provides ways to improve
the broader policy making process, through better engagement and
consultation. It has the potential to transform democratic participation in the policy process, and improve the design of policy itself. The <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform">Civil Service Reform Plan</a> states 
<em>&ldquo;Open policy making will become the default&rdquo;</em> and we will use digital to achieve that outcome.</p>

  <p>We have already developed better skills in listening and responding to
public feedback through digital channels. In May 2012, social media
guidelines were issued to civil servants based on six principles &ndash; that
government should:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>communicate with citizens in the places they already are</li>
    <li>use social media to consult and engage</li>
    <li>use social media to be more transparent and accountable</li>
    <li>be part of the conversation with all the benefits that brings</li>
    <li>understand that government can&rsquo;t do everything alone</li>
    <li>expect civil servants to adhere to the <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/values">Civil Service Code</a> (online
as well as offline)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said: </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;When civil servants, policy makers and service delivery units alike, open
themselves to dialogue with the public they can glean a much better
understanding of the real needs and concerns of citizens. They can keep
up to date with the latest thinking as well as being a listening post
and avenue for real time reassurance and information&rdquo;.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Civil servants are exploring the opportunities social media offers,
whether by entering into dialogue, consulting and engaging, improving their policy making or
simply listening to people&rsquo;s concerns. For example, Department of Health
made a draft Bill openly available for comment online using social media
in July 2012. This increased openness and made it straightforward for
people to comment on individual clauses or topics before the Bill was
introduced to Parliament. This ran alongside other offline stakeholder
engagement. The Red Tape Challenge website &lsquo;crowd sources&rsquo; views from business, organisations and the public on which regulations should be improved, kept &lsquo;as is&rsquo; or scrapped. These comments have directly influenced <a href="https://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/progress-to-date">the decisions to scrap or overhaul</a> over 1,100 regulations (of the 2,300 examined by November 2012).</p>

  <p>Departments will train and develop policy teams to understand and use a
wider range of digital methods and channels. They will use these to
engage and consult with the public on a daily basis around areas of
policy development, up to and including formal consultations. Cabinet
Office will also provide training to policy teams on the potential of
digital by default approaches as they draw up policy proposals.</p>

  <p>We are developing a range of consultation and engagement tools as part
of GOV.UK, supported by guidance to civil servants on effective online
consultation techniques and approaches.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Transactional services</dt>
    <dd>Transactional services include interactions with
the government, from booking driving tests and filing tax returns to
setting up a company and applying for a public house licence: everything
which involves sharing information, requesting services, buying goods,
asking for permission, or paying money.</dd>
    <dt>Information services</dt>
    <dd>Information services cover the publishing of information to help citizens and businesses in their engagement with government. For example, in August 2012, one of the most visited informational pages on Directgov listed the dates of forthcoming public holidays.</dd>
    <dt>Digital</dt>
    <dd>By &lsquo;digital&rsquo;, we mean internet-enabled; such as desktop,
laptop, tablet, mobile or digital devices not yet invented.</dd>
    <dt>Executive board</dt>
    <dd>An &lsquo;executive board&rsquo; will typically be a sub-committee of the departmental ministerial board and may also be referred to as &lsquo;management board&rsquo; or &lsquo;executive committee&rsquo;. 
Departments will ensure that there is engaged leadership at sufficiently senior level to make service transformation possible.</dd>
    <dt>API</dt>
    <dd>An application programming interface (or API) is a way of making
information available to other developers for use in tools and services.
APIs allow developers to use information quickly and easily, and help to
ensure that they can access data in the most efficient way available.</dd>
    <dt>Systems Integrator</dt>
    <dd>A systems integrator (or SI) is an individual or
business that builds computing systems for clients by combining hardware
and software products from multiple vendors and ensuring that those
subsystems function together.</dd>
    <dt>Small and Medium Sized Enterprises</dt>
    <dd>Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (or SMEs) are defined by the European Commission as enterprises which
employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not
exceeding &euro;50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;43 million.</dd>
    <dt>Agile</dt>
    <dd>An approach where projects and products progress and develop in
incremental iterations. The product works from a very early stage, so
improvement can be made based on real user feedback and testing.</dd>

  <h3 id="government-digital-service-transformation-team">Government Digital Service transformation team</h3>

  <p>The transformation team works with departments, agencies, non-departmental public bodies and arms length bodies
on their digital transformation projects. It helps
establish what departments do, who departments do it for, legacy
challenges, in-house digital capability, and savings opportunities
from channel shift and technology replacement. It supports them using either a co-delivery or consultancy model.</p>

  <p>The main objective is to provide user-focused, cost effective and
maintainable digital services.</p>

  <h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>implementation of controls and governance for digital
transformation projects</li>
    <li>assessment and approval of departmental digital projects</li>
    <li>detailed feasibility and direction-setting</li>
    <li>building and supporting departments digital capability</li>
    <li>establishing a new government supplier chain for digital services
using small and medium sized enterprises</li>
    <li>managing delivery and benefits realisation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="governance-and-controls">Governance and controls</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Government Digital Service operates a set of controls for Cabinet Office to control spend
on digital projects and initiatives</li>
    <li>these are managed in conjunction with departments through the
Digital Leader Network</li>
    <li>propositions are formally submitted to and reviewed by the
transformation team, with collaboration from the submitting
department</li>
    <li>two formal boards control the approval of recommended approaches,
spend control exercise and Efficiency and Reform Group wider approval with IT Reform Group and
Commercial Models Team</li>
    <li>all propositions must deliver user value and financial savings</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/strategy/opportunity_map.png" alt="Tranformation programme governanace" /></p>

  <h3 id="assessment-criteria">Assessment criteria</h3>

  <p>Departmental propositions are assessed at different stages of the process
but a common theme runs throughout:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>what is the department trying to do?</li>
    <li>who are they doing it for?</li>
    <li>what is the investment and savings opportunity?</li>
    <li>what constraints do we face (people/process/technology)?</li>
    <li>how will we measure success?</li>
    <li>what factors are critical to success?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Given the above, a recommendation is put forward.</p>

  <p>Departments are encouraged to use the same assessment criteria during
their own service proposition (portfolio) management process.</p>

  <p>An example of an existing departmental proposition management process
is given below.</p>

<div class="section">

  <h2 class="section-title" id="initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard"><span class="title-index">Annex 3</span><span class="title-text">Initial outline of proposed digital by default (transactional) service standard</span></h2>

  <p>The digital by default standard will define what is considered
high quality for a new or redesigned digital transactional service. It
will be used across government to ensure that all digital services are
of a consistently high standard.</p>

  <p>The guidance and tools supporting the standard will help service owners
to design trusted, cost-effective government services that are embraced
by users and meet their needs first time. Government Digital Service
will ensure there is a common understanding across government of what
outcomes are required to meet the standard. This understanding must be
shared by everyone involved in the development and life of a new or
redesigned digital service.</p>

  <p>The standard will be accompanied by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a programme of guidance and toolkits that help service teams to
achieve outcomes which meet the standard throughout the development
and life of the service. This guidance will build and expand upon
previous Government Digital Service best practice, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Government Digital Service Design Principles</li>
        <li>Performance Framework</li>
        <li>visual and interaction design toolkits</li>
        <li>content style guides</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>a reporting tool that makes it simple to demonstrate the
performance of new and redesigned services against the standard, and
provides service owners with an easy-to-use dashboard to monitor the
progress of a service&rsquo;s redesign against the capabilities required
to pass the standard</li>
    <li>a governance structure detailing what level of assessment against
the performance outcomes is required at different stages of a
redesign project and who will conduct that assessment, according to
the size and/or impact of the service being redesigned</li>
    <li>a programme of communications that explains the standard, provides
training and support and encourages effective knowledge sharing
between departments</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following description of the standard represents an early draft of
what it may contain. Any numbers contained within it are indicative and
subject to change. This will be improved over the next few months as
Government Digital Service adds more detailed definition and supporting
evidence behind the standard&rsquo;s requirements in terms of performance
outcomes and capabilities. Government Digital Service will consult with
departments on the details of the standard.</p>

  <h3 id="the-standard">The standard</h3>

  <p>Judgements about the quality of a redesigned service should ultimately
be made by its users. The digital standard will set out metrics for monitoring and evaluating how well user needs are being met
by redesigned services, and a capability checklist to guide service
owners and designers in building the transactions to meet those needs. All new and redesigned services must perform well
across a range of areas to meet this standard. </p>

  <p>Government Digital Service will consult with departments on the details
of the digital standard over the next 6 months.</p>

  <h4 id="service-uptake">Service uptake</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>redesigned transactional services must follow a trajectory of
digital channel uptake, set at a speed according to the service&rsquo;s
expected user demographics and in line with service-specific user research and feedback. This will be used for forecasting and setting targets; whilst these will vary service by service, general best practice suggests that an outcome of around 80% of transactions 
completed digitally without assistance within 5 years of launch could be achievable</li>
    <li>progress against the uptake trajectory will be monitored by
service owners continuously, and by Government Digital Service at
intervals set according to the size and/or impact of the service</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="cost-per-transaction">Cost per transaction</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>redesigned transactional services must demonstrate they are
following a downward trajectory for the average cost per completed
transaction. This will be defined in line with the Quarterly Data Summary
(QDS) guidance, ie by dividing the total number of transactions by
the full cost of the transactional service</li>
    <li>performance will be monitored against achieving a fixed baseline
cost per transaction (which Government Digital Service will determine) within 5 years of
launch. Government Digital Service will analyse QDS data returns for
Q3 and Q4 2012/13 to set the baseline cost and trajectory</li>
    <li>progress against the cost per transaction trajectory will be
monitored at least quarterly, in line with the QDS reporting cycle</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="transaction-success-rate">Transaction success rate</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>redesigned transactional services must achieve at least a baseline
level of transaction success, defined as users successfully
fulfilling their needs by using the service</li>
    <li>Government Digital Service will work with web analytics experts to
develop a detailed definition of service success to be included in
the standard, and set the baseline level of performance according to
industry-recognised best practice</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="user-satisfaction">User satisfaction</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>redesigned transactional services must be designed to meet
identified user needs, and consistently achieve a satisfaction rate
of at least 70%. This score will be based on a common survey
sampling methodology and set of questions</li>
    <li>Government Digital Service will work with user testing experts and
departments to build an established methodology for redesigned
transactions, ensuring that all services have customer satisfaction
data which is automatically collected and easily comparable between
different services and over time</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="operational-capability">Operational capability</h4>

  <p>Redesigned transactional services should be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>managed by a suitably skilled and empowered Service Manager</li>
    <li>designed to work seamlessly through digital and non-digital stages
of a process</li>
    <li>measuring and monitoring performance against key indicators from
the point of launch</li>
    <li>improved at least monthly based on qualitative feedback from users
and quantitative measures from analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="design">Design</h4>

  <p>Redesigned transactional services will be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>simple and intuitive enough for users to succeed first time,
unaided</li>
    <li>designed for inclusion, so all who could use it do use it</li>
    <li>make use of common design and user experience tools, so once
people have done something once, they will be able to do it
elsewhere</li>
    <li>redesigned using feedback received from a private or public alpha
phase, and a public beta phase</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="development-and-technology">Development and technology</h4>

  <p>Redesigned transactional services should be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>developed using agile, iterative, user-centric digital development
methodologies, using open source code by default</li>
    <li>make use of common cross-government technology platforms</li>
    <li>make use of and meet open standards</li>
    <li>offer high-quality APIs, enabling reliable reuse by third parties
and integration with other government services</li>
    <li>capable of working on all common browsers and a wide range of
web-enabled devices, including mobile phones</li>
    <li>impartially, robustly and regularly tested throughout the design
and lifetime of the service</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="legality-security-and-resilience">Legality, security and resilience</h4>

  <p>Transactional services will be redesigned to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>be robustly protective of the security of sensitive user information</li>
    <li>maintain the privacy and security of all personal information</li>
    <li>be resilient, to ensure continuity of service to users and
departments</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="the-guidance">The guidance</h3>

  <p>Government Digital Service will actively support transactional service
owners in helping them to commission, design, build and iteratively
improve services that meet and maintain the digital by default standard.</p>

  <p>Government Digital Service has already produced a number of best
practice guidance documents to support departments looking to improve
the quality of their transactional service and digital offering,
including the Design Principles and Performance Framework. Building on
and incorporating these products, Government Digital Service will
develop a &lsquo;handbook&rsquo; to support the digital by default standard, with
practical steps and best practice examples to bring the steps redesigned
services will take to life. This will include information to cover all
core capability requirements set out in the standard.</p>

  <p>Government Digital Service will work closely with departments on the
development of the guidance and ensure it remains a working document. It
will seek to iteratively improve this as further examples of good practice
come to light, and encourage service owners to inform future versions.</p>

  <p>To accompany the written guidance, Government Digital Service will set
up a series of training and tutorial opportunities for service owners.
These will be based around a core curriculum that covers the
capabilities as set out in the standard, and focused on areas which the
service owners themselves raise as being particularly valuable in terms
of targeted support and expert advice.</p>

  <p>Government Digital Service will bring in government and external experts
from areas such as web analytics, data visualisation and user testing to
support this curriculum, and give service owners the networks,
opportunities and forums to share knowledge between themselves.</p>

  <p>Where departments have nominated specific large transactional services
for redesign, Government Digital Service will seek to provide targeted
project support. The terms and level of involvement will be decided on a
case-by-case basis, according to the level and type of transformation in
scope.</p>

  <h3 id="how-services-will-be-assessed">How services will be assessed</h3>

  <p>For all new and redesigned services, progress should be continually
measured against performance outcomes by service owners, using the
reporting tool built by Government Digital Service. Government Digital
Service will monitor at intervals according to the size of the service.</p>

  <p>All services will undergo a formal review ahead of launch. After launch,
they will continue to be continually monitored by service owners and by
Government Digital Service at regular intervals to ensure that the
standard is being maintained and services are iteratively improved.</p>

  <p>Departments will be responsible for how they plan the redesign of their services.</p>

  <p>Departmental decisions on priorities for determining the order that
services come forward for end-to-end redesign will therefore vary
according to circumstances and opportunities, but prioritisation could
be based on any of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>high volume, high impact processes where improvements will benefit
a lot of users rapidly</li>
    <li>quick wins, where there is opportunity to do a short sharp piece
of work to transform a service (or important aspects of it)</li>
    <li>services where a high proportion of potential users are already
online, providing opportunities to achieve high digital take-up
rapidly</li>
    <li>breaks in contract provision, where a change offers an opportunity
for a re-appraisal of what is delivered and how</li>
    <li>a service currently perceived as problematic or &lsquo;failing&rsquo;, where a
transformational redesign will reduce user frustration or
operational inefficiencies resulting in savings</li>
    <li>&lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; opportunities to introduce new digital services</li>
    <li>opportunities or inter-dependencies within or between departments
to provide more holistic and connected services to users (Digital
Leaders and Government Digital Service will actively look for such
opportunities as plans are drawn up)</li>
